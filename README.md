ideas/desired features:
  have a teacher side and a student side
  create a website where teachers/professors can create a quiz/test for students.
  gives them an option to either print their quiz or create an id to give to students, who could log on and take the test on the website, in which case the website grades the test/quiz and saves that info and gives it back to the teacher.
  give the admin the ability to save the quizzes and edit them later
  ability to create different formats (multiple choice, etc)
